== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is CSS clamp() and why should I use it? =

CSS clamp() creates truly responsive typography that scales smoothly between minimum and maximum sizes based on viewport width. This eliminates the need for multiple media queries and creates more fluid, accessible designs.

= Can I use this with any WordPress theme? =

Yes! Fluid Font Forge generates standard CSS that works with any theme. You can use the generated classes, custom properties, or tag styles depending on your implementation preference.

= Does this work with custom fonts? =

Absolutely. The preview system supports WOFF2 font URLs so you can see exactly how your custom fonts will look at different sizes before implementing them.

= Is the generated CSS production-ready? =

Yes. The plugin generates clean, optimized CSS using best practices. The clamp() functions are supported in all modern browsers with automatic fallbacks.

= Can I export my settings? =

The plugin saves all your configurations in the WordPress database. For backup or migration, use WordPress's standard export/import tools or copy the generated CSS for manual implementation.
